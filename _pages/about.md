{% include base_path %}

I am a PhD student at the [Key Laboratory of Systems and Control](http://lsc.amss.cas.cn) of the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I received my B.E. in Automation from University of Science and Technology of China in 2017.

My research is at the interface between machine learning and computational biology. My primary research interest lies in developing new computational algorithms for the study of large-scale genomic data, especially related to the single-cell sequencing data. The specific topics I have examined include:
* Computational method development for integration of single-cell multi-omics datasets
* High-performance transfer learning algorithm development for large-scale single-cell sequencing data
