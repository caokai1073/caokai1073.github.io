I am a PhD student at the [Key Laboratory of Systems and Control](http://lsc.amss.cas.cn) of the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I received my B.E. in Automation from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2017.

My research is at the interface between machine learning and computational biology. My primary research interest lies in developing new computational algorithms for the study of large-scale genomic data, especially related to the single-cell sequencing data. My current research focuses on:
* Computational method development for integration of single-cell multi-omics datasets
* High-performance transfer learning algorithm development for single-cell sequencing data

Latest paper: <br>
[Manifold alignment for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data integration using Pamona](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.366146v1)<br>
